# Python 3.10+ required
# No external packages required - all projects use Python standard library only

# Standard library modules used:
# - random (for games with randomization)
# - turtle (for graphics projects - included in standard library)
# - sys (for system operations in some projects)

# Note: On some Linux systems, turtle graphics may require:
# sudo apt-get install python3-tk
